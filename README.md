I kept telling myself I would not use formal MVC for this project, so it would remain very simple and easy to
understand. The more I kept going though, the more convoluted the code got, and so I did this entire rewrite.
This code is drastically different from the last app. I will be loading this with comments to make it very
simple to follow.

My biggest intention with this app is to present a friendly introduction to MVC architecture, because I
think it helps to have some of basic building block knowledge before jumping into a framework. Although,
I definitely recommended using a framework for large applications, as it will help ensure your techniques
are standardized and secure, and it will let you jump right into the meat of your code, right away.
