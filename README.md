My biggest intention with this app is to present a friendly introduction to MVC architecture, because I
think it helps to have some of basic building block knowledge before jumping into a framework. Although,
I definitely recommended using a framework for large applications, as it will help ensure your techniques
are standardized and secure, and it will let you jump right into the meat of your code, right away.
